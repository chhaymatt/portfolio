# Portfolio


# Introduction
This is my portfolio to showcase what I have been learning during the course and to give visitors an insight to who I am. It will be updated after each project completion or additional skill.

# Sections on my portoflio
- ✅ A landing section

# To do
- ⏰ Syling contains mixins (plan: reduce duplicate code)
- ⏰ Styling mixins are stored in styles/partials 
- ⏰ Styling sections are stored in styles/modules
- ⏰ Styling contains media queries for responsiveness (plan: reduce heading sizes, padding for smaller screen sizes)
